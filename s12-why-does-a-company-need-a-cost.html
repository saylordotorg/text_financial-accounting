        <ol class="orderedlist" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_l01">
            <li>Understand the reason that accounting rules are often standardized so that all companies report many events in the same manner.</li>
            <li>Know that the selection of a particular cost flow assumption is necessary when inventory is sold.</li>
            <li>Apply the following cost flow assumptions to determine reported balances for ending inventory and cost of goods sold: specific identification, FIFO, LIFO, and averaging.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question: In the coverage of financial accounting to this point, general standardization has been evident. Most transactions are recorded in an identical fashion by all companies. This defined structure helps ensure understanding. It also enhances the ability of decision makers to compare results from one year to the next or from one company to another. For example, inventory—except in unusual circumstances—is always reported at historical cost unless its value is lower. Experienced decision makers should be well aware of that criterion when they are reviewing the inventory figures reported by a company</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">However, an examination of the notes to financial statements for some well-known businesses shows an interesting inconsistency in the reporting of inventory (emphasis added)</em>.</p>

				<em class="emphasis">“Specific-identification basis,” “first-in, first-out,” “last-in, first-out,” “average cost”—what information do these terms provide? Why are all of these companies using different methods?</em>

			</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p09">Answer: In the previous chapter, the cost of all inventory items was kept constant over time. Although that helped simplify the initial presentation of relevant accounting issues, such stability is hardly a realistic assumption. For example, the retail price of gasoline has moved up and down like a yo-yo in recent years. The cost of some commodities, such as bread and soft drinks, has increased gradually for many decades. In other industries, prices actually tend to fall over time. New technology products often start with a high price that drops as the manufacturing process ramps up and becomes more efficient. Several years ago, personal computers cost tens of thousands of dollars and now sell for hundreds.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p10">A key event in accounting for inventory is the transfer of cost from the inventory T-account to cost of goods sold as the result of a sale. The inventory balance is reduced and the related expense is increased. For large organizations, such transactions can take place thousands of times each day. If each item has an identical cost, no problem exists. This standard amount is always reclassified into expense to reflect the sale.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p11">However, if inventory items are acquired at different costs, which cost is moved from asset to expense? At that point, a cost flow assumption must be selected by company officials to guide reporting. That choice can have a significant impact on both the income statement and the balance sheet. It is literally impossible to analyze the reported net income and inventory balance of a company such as ExxonMobil without knowing the cost flow assumption that has been applied.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p12"><em class="emphasis">Question: An example is probably the easiest approach by which to demonstrate cost flow assumptions. Assume a men’s retail clothing store holds $120 in cash. On October 26, Year One, one blue dress shirt is bought for $50 in cash for resell purposes. Later, near the end of the year, this style of shirt becomes especially popular. On December 29, Year One, the store’s manager buys a second shirt exactly like the first but this time at a cost of $70. Cash on hand has been depleted completely ($120 less $50 and $70) but the company now holds two shirts in its inventory</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p13"><em class="emphasis">Then, on December 31, Year One, a customer buys one of these two shirts by paying cash of $110. Regardless of the cost flow assumption, the company retains one blue dress shirt in inventory at the end of the year and cash of $110. It also reports sales revenue of $110. Those facts are not in doubt</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p14">
				<em class="emphasis">From an accounting perspective, two questions are left to be resolved (1) what is the cost of goods sold reported for the one shirt that was sold and (2) what is the cost remaining in inventory for the one item still on hand?</em>
			</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p15"><em class="emphasis">In simpler terms, should the $50 or $70 be reclassified to cost of goods sold; should the $50 or $70 remain in ending inventory? For financial accounting, the importance of the answers to those questions cannot be overemphasized</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">What are the various cost flow assumptions and how are they applied to inventory?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p16">Answer: <em class="emphasis">SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION</em>. In a literal sense, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specific identification</a><span class="glossdef">Inventory cost flow method in which a company physically identifies both its remaining inventory and the inventory that was sold to customers.</span></span> is not a cost flow assumption. Companies that use this approach are not making an assumption because they know which item was sold. By some technique, they are able to identify the inventory conveyed to the customer and reclassify its cost to expense.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p17">For some types of inventory, such as automobiles held by a car dealer, specific identification is relatively easy to apply. Each vehicle tends to be somewhat unique and can be tracked through identification numbers. Unfortunately, for many other types of inventory, no practical method exists for determining the physical flow of merchandise.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p18">Thus, if the men’s retail store maintains a system where the individual shirts are marked in some way, it will be possible to know whether the $50 shirt or the $70 shirt was actually conveyed to the customer. That cost can be moved from asset to expense.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p19">However, for identical items like shirts, cans of tuna fish, bags of coffee beans, hammers, packs of notebook paper and the like, the idea of maintaining such precise records is ludicrous. What informational benefit could be gained by knowing whether the first blue shirt was sold or the second? In most cases, the cost of creating such a meticulous record-keeping system far outweighs any potential advantages.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p20"><em class="emphasis">FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO)</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">FIFO</a><span class="glossdef">Inventory cost flow assumption based on the oldest costs being transferred first from inventory to cost of goods sold so that the most recent costs remain in ending inventory.</span></span> cost flow assumption is based on the premise that selling the oldest item first is most likely to mirror reality. Stores do not want inventory to grow unnecessarily old and lose freshness. The oldest items are often placed on top in hopes that they will sell first before becoming stale or damaged. Therefore, although the identity of the actual item sold is rarely known, the assumption is made in applying FIFO that the first (or oldest) cost is always moved from inventory to cost of goods sold.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p21">Note that it is not the oldest item that is necessarily sold but rather the oldest cost that is reclassified to cost of goods sold. No attempt is made to determine which shirt was purchased by the customer. Here, because the first shirt cost $50, the following entry is made to record the expense and reduce the inventory.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p22">For this retail store, the following financial information is reported if FIFO is applied. Two shirts were bought for ($50 and $70) and one shirt was sold for $110.</p>

        </table>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p23">In a period of rising prices, the earliest (cheapest) cost moves to cost of goods sold and the latest (more expensive) cost is retained in ending inventory. For this reason, in inflationary times, FIFO is associated with a higher reported net income as well as a higher reported inventory total on the company’s balance sheet. Not surprisingly, these characteristics help make it a popular choice.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p26">Theoretically, the LIFO assumption is often justified as more in line with the matching principle. Shirt One was bought on October 26 whereas Shirt Two was not acquired until December 29. Revenue was earned on December 31. Proponents of LIFO argue that matching the December 29 cost with the December 31 revenue is more appropriate than using a cost incurred months earlier. According to this reasoning, income is more properly determined with LIFO because a relatively current cost is shown as cost of goods sold rather than a figure that is out-of-date. The difference is especially apparent in periods of high inflation. “By matching current costs against current sales, LIFO produces a truer picture of income; that is, the quality of income produced by the use of LIFO is higher because it more nearly approximates disposable income.”<span class="footnote" id="hoyle-fn09_001">Clayton T. Rumble, “So You Still Have Not Adopted LIFO,” <em class="emphasis">Management Accountant</em>, October 1983, 50.</span> Note 1 to the 2008 financial statements for ConocoPhillips reiterates that point: “LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p27">The last cost incurred in buying two blue shirts was $70 so that amount is reclassified to expense at the time of the first sale.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p28">Although the physical results of these transaction are the same (one unit was sold, one unit was retained, and the company holds $110 in cash), the financial picture painted using the LIFO cost flow assumption is quite different from in the earlier FIFO example.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p29">Characteristics commonly associated with LIFO can be seen in this example. When prices rise, LIFO companies report lower net income (the most recent and, thus, the most costly purchases are moved to expense) and a lower inventory account on the balance sheet (because the earlier and cheaper costs remain in the inventory T-account). As will be discussed in a subsequent section, LIFO is popular in the United States because it helps reduce the amount companies pay in income taxes.</p>

Because the identity of the items conveyed to buyers is unknown, this final cost flow assumption holds that using an average of all costs is the most logical solution. Why choose any individual cost if no evidence exists of its validity? The first item received might have been sold or the last. Selecting either is an arbitrary decision. If items with varying costs are held, using an average provides a very appealing logic. In the shirt example, the two units cost a total of $120 ($50 plus $70) so the average is $60 ($120/2 units).</p>

Company officials often arrive at such practical decisions based on an evaluation of advantages and disadvantages and not on theoretical merit.</p>

        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s01_p35">U.S. GAAP tends to apply standard reporting rules for many transactions to make financial statements more usable by decision makers. The application of an inventory cost flow assumption is one area where a significant variation is present. A company can choose to use specific identification, first-in, first-out (FIFO), last-in, first-out (LIFO), or averaging. Each of these assumptions determines the cost moved from inventory to cost of goods sold to reflect the sale of merchandise in a different manner. The reported inventory balance as well as the expense on the income statement (and, hence, net income) are dependent on the cost flow assumption that is selected.</p>

Is the gross profit for this men’s clothing store really $60 (FIFO), $40 (LIFO), or $50 (averaging) in connection with the sale of one blue shirt?

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p03">Answer: Because specific identification reclassifies the cost of the actual unit that was sold, finding theoretical fault with that approach is difficult. Unfortunately, specific identification is nearly impossible to apply unless easily distinguishable differences exist between similar inventory items. That leaves FIFO, LIFO, and averaging. Arguments over both their merits and problems have raged for decades. Ultimately, the numbers in financial statements must be presented fairly based on the cost flow assumption that is applied.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p04">In <a class="xref" href="hoyle-ch06#hoyle-ch06">Chapter 6 "Why Should Decision Makers Trust Financial Statements?"</a>, an important distinction was made. The report of the independent auditor never assures decision makers that financial statements are “presented fairly.” That is a hopelessly abstract concept like truth and beauty. Instead, the auditor states that the statements are “presented fairly…in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.” That is a substantially more objective standard. Thus, for this men’s clothing store, all the following figures are presented fairly but only in conformity with the cost flow assumption used by the reporting company.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p06">Answer: To help interested parties gauge the usage of various accounting principles, a survey is carried out annually of the financial statements of six hundred large companies in this country. The resulting information allows accountants, auditors, and decision makers to weigh the validity of a particular method or presentation. For 2007, that survey found the following frequency of application of cost flow assumptions. Some companies use multiple assumptions: one for a particular part of inventory and a different one for the remainder. Thus, the total here is well above six hundred even though over one hundred of the surveyed companies did not have inventory or mention a cost flow assumption (inventory was probably an immaterial amount). As will be discussed a bit later in this chapter, using multiple assumptions is especially common when a U.S. company has subsidiaries located internationally.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p07">Interestingly, individual cost flow assumptions tend to be more prevalent in certain industries. In this same survey, 86 percent of the financial statements issued by food and drug stores used LIFO whereas only 10 percent of the companies labeled as “computers, office equipment” had adopted this same approach. That difference could quite possibly be caused by the presence of inflation or deflation. Prices of food and drugs tend to escalate consistently over time while computer prices often fall as technology advances</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p08"><em class="emphasis">Question: In periods of inflation, as demonstrated by the previous example, FIFO reports a higher gross profit (and, hence, net income) and a higher inventory balance than does LIFO. Averaging presents figures that normally fall between these two extremes. Such results are widely expected by those readers of financial statements who understand the impact of the various cost flow assumptions</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p09"><em class="emphasis">Any one of these methods is permitted for financial reporting. Why is FIFO not the obvious choice for every organization that anticipates inflation in its inventory costs? Officials must prefer to report figures that make the company look stronger and more profitable. With every rise in prices, FIFO shows a higher income because the earlier (cheaper) costs are transferred to cost of goods sold. Likewise, FIFO reports a higher total inventory on the balance sheet because the later (higher) cost figures are retained in the inventory T-account. The company is no different physically by this decision but FIFO makes it look better</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why does any company voluntarily choose LIFO, an approach that reduces reported income and total assets when prices rise?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p10">Answer: LIFO might well have faded into oblivion because of its negative impact on key reported figures (during inflationary periods) except for a U.S. income tax requirement known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">LIFO conformity rule</a><span class="glossdef">A United States income tax rule that requires LIFO to be used for financial reporting purposes if it is adopted for taxation purposes.</span></span>. Although this tax regulation is not part of U.S. GAAP and looks rather innocuous, it has a huge impact on the way inventory and cost of goods sold are reported to decision makers in this country.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p11">As prices rise, companies prefer to apply LIFO for tax purposes because this assumption reduces reported income and, hence, required cash payments to the government. In the United States, LIFO has come to be universally equated with the saving of tax dollars. When LIFO was first proposed as a tax method in the 1930s, the United States Treasury Department appointed a panel of three experts to consider its validity. The members of this group were split over a final resolution. They eventually agreed to recommend that LIFO be allowed for income tax purposes but only if the company was also willing to use LIFO for financial reporting. At that point, tax rules bled over into U.S. GAAP.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p12">The rationale behind this compromise was that companies were allowed the option but probably would not choose LIFO for their tax returns because of the potential negative effect on figures reported to investors, creditors, and others. During inflationary periods, companies that apply LIFO do not look as financially healthy as those that adopt FIFO. Eventually this recommendation was put into law and the LIFO conformity rule was born. If LIFO is used on a company’s income tax return, it must also be applied on the financial statements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p13">However, as the previous statistics point out, this requirement did not prove to be the deterrent that was anticipated. Actual use of LIFO has become quite popular. For many companies, the savings in income tax dollars more than outweigh the problem of having to report numbers that make the company look a bit weaker. That is a choice that company officials must make.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p16">Answer: In jokes and in editorials, companies are often derisively accused of “keeping two sets of books.” The implication is that one is skewed toward making the company look good (for reporting purposes) whereas the other makes the company look bad (for taxation purposes). However, the existence of separate records is a practical necessity. One set is kept based on applicable tax laws while the other enables the company to prepare its financial statements according to U.S. GAAP. Different rules mean that different numbers result.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p17">In filing income taxes with the United States government, a company must follow the regulations of the Internal Revenue Code.<span class="footnote" id="hoyle-fn09_003">Many states also charge a tax on income. These states have their own unique set of laws although they often resemble the tax laws applied by the federal government.</span> Those laws have several underlying objectives that influence their development.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p18"><strong class="emphasis bold">First</strong>, they are designed to raise money for the operation of the federal government. Without adequate funding, the government could not provide hospitals, build roads, maintain a military and the like.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p19"><strong class="emphasis bold">Second</strong>, income tax laws enable the government to help regulate the health of the economy. Simply by raising or lowering tax rates, the government can take money out of the economy (and slow public spending) or leave money in the economy (and increase public spending). As an illustration, recently a significant tax break was passed by Congress for first-time home buyers. This move was designed to stimulate the housing market by encouraging additional individuals to consider making a purchase.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p20"><strong class="emphasis bold">Third</strong>, income tax laws enable the government to assist certain members of society who are viewed as deserving help. For example, taxpayers who encounter high medical costs or casualty losses are entitled to a tax break. Donations conveyed to an approved charity can also reduce a taxpayer’s tax bill. The rules and regulations were designed to provide assistance for specified needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p21">In contrast, financial reporting for decision makers must abide by the guidance of U.S. GAAP, which seeks to set rules for the fair presentation of accounting information. That is the reason U.S. GAAP exists. Because the goals are entirely different, there is no particular reason for the resulting financial statements to correspond to the tax figures submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Not surprisingly, though, significant overlap is found between tax laws and U.S. GAAP. For example, both normally recognize the cash sale of merchandise as revenue at the time of sale. However, countless differences do exist between the two sets of rules. Depreciation, as just one example, is computed in an entirely different manner for tax purposes than for financial reporting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p22">Although separately developed, financial statements and income tax returns are tied together at one significant spot: the LIFO conformity rule. If a company chooses to use LIFO for tax purposes, it must do the same for financial reporting. Without that requirement, many companies likely would use FIFO in creating their financial statements and LIFO for their income tax returns. Much of the popularity shown earlier for LIFO is undoubtedly derived from this tax requirement rather than any theoretical merit.</p>
    <div class="key_takeaways editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_n03">
        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s02_p23">Information found in financial statements is required to be presented fairly in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Because several inventory cost flow assumptions are allowed, presented numbers can vary significantly from one company to another and still be appropriate. FIFO, LIFO, and averaging are all popular. Understanding and comparing financial statements is quite difficult without knowing the implications of the method selected. LIFO, for example, tends to produce low-income figures in a period of inflation. This assumption probably would not be used extensively except for the LIFO conformity rule that prohibits its use for tax purposes unless also reported on the company’s financial statements. Typically, financial reporting and the preparation of income tax returns are unrelated because two sets of rules are used with radically differing objectives. However, the LIFO conformity rule joins these two at this one key spot.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question: As a result of the LIFO conformity rule in the tax laws, this cost flow assumption is widely used in the United States. LIFO, though, is not allowed in many other areas of the world. It is not simply unpopular in those locations; its application is strictly forbidden. Thus, international companies are often forced to resort to alternatives in reporting their foreign subsidiaries. For example, a footnote to the 2008 financial statements of American Biltrite Inc. explains that “Inventories are stated at the lower-of-cost-or-market. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for most of the Company’s domestic inventories. The use of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for the Company’s foreign inventories</em>.”</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p04">Answer: Although LIFO can be supported as providing a proper matching of expenses (cost of goods sold) with revenues, a number of serious theoretical problems are created by its application. The most common accusation against LIFO is that it often presents a balance sheet number that is completely out-of-date and useless. When applying this assumption, the latest costs get moved to cost of goods sold so the earlier costs remain in the inventory account—possibly for years and even decades. After some period of time, this asset balance is likely to report a number that has no relevance to today’s prices.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p05">For example, in its 2007 financial statements, ExxonMobil reported inventory on its balance sheet at slightly over $11.1 billion based on applying LIFO. In the footnotes to those financial statements, the company disclosed that the current cost to acquire this same inventory was $25.4 billion higher than the number being reported. The asset was shown as $11.1 billion but the price to buy that same inventory was actually $36.5 billion ($11.1 billion plus $25.4). What is the possible informational value of reporting an asset that is being held for sale at an amount more than $25 billion below its current value?<span class="footnote" id="hoyle-fn09_004">As will be seen in the next chapter, similar arguments are made in connection with property and equipment—the reported amount and the value can vary greatly. However, those assets are not normally held for resale purpose so that current worth is of much less interest to decision makers.</span> That is the essential problem attributed to LIFO.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p06">To illustrate, assume that a gas station has a tank that holds ten thousand gallons of gasoline. On January 1, Year One, the tank is filled at a cost of $1 per gallon. Almost immediately the price of gasoline jumps to $2 per gallon. During the remainder of Year One, the station buys and sells one million gallons of gas. Thus, ten thousand gallons remain in the tank at year’s end: ten thousand gallons plus one million gallons bought minus one million gallons sold equals ten thousand gallons. LIFO and FIFO report these results as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p07">After just one period, the asset balance shown by LIFO ($1 per gallon) is already beginning to differ from the current cost of $2 per gallon.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p08">If this company continues to buy and sell the same amount annually so that it finishes each year with a full tank of ten thousand gallons (certainly not an unreasonable assumption), LIFO will continue to report this inventory at $1 per gallon for the following decades regardless of current prices. New costs always get transferred to cost of goods sold leaving the first costs ($1 per gallon) in inventory. The tendency to report this asset at a cost expended many years in the past is the single biggest reason that LIFO is viewed as an illegitimate method in many countries. And that same sentiment would probably exist in the United States except for the LIFO conformity rule.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p11">Answer: As demonstrated above, over time, costs from much earlier years often remain in the inventory T-account when LIFO is applied. A gasoline station that opens in 1972 and ends each year with a full tank of ten thousand gallons of gasoline will report its inventory balance at 1972 costs even in the year 2010 when using LIFO. However, if the quantity of the ending inventory is ever allowed to decrease (accidentally or on purpose), some or all of those 1972 costs move to cost of goods sold. Revenue earned in 2010 is then matched with costs from 1972. That is a LIFO liquidation that can artificially inflate reported earnings if those earlier costs are relatively low.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p12">To illustrate, assume that a station starts 2010 with ten thousand gallons of gasoline. LIFO has been applied over the years so that the inventory is reported at the 1972 cost of $0.42 per gallon. In the current year, gasoline cost $2.55 per gallon to buy and is then sold to the public for $2.70 per gallon creating a normal gross profit of $0.15 per gallon. That is the amount of income that a station is making at this time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p13">At the beginning of 2010, the station sells its entire stock of ten thousand gallons of gasoline and then ceases to carry this product (perhaps the owners want to focus on groceries or automobile parts). Without any replacement of the inventory, the cost of the gasoline bought in 1972 for $0.42 per gallon is shifted from inventory to cost of goods sold in 2010. Instead of the normal profit margin of $0.15 per gallon or $1,500 for ten thousand gallons, the company reports a gross profit of $2.28 per gallon ($2.70 sales price minus $0.42 cost of goods sold). That amount does not reflect the reality of current market conditions. It allows the company to look overly profitable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p14">In a LIFO liquidation, costs from an earlier period are matched with revenues of the present year. Revenue is measured in 2010 dollars but cost of goods sold is stated in 1972 prices. Although the reported figures are technically correct, the implication that this station can earn a gross profit of $2.28 per gallon is misleading.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p15">To allow decision makers to properly understand the effect that a LIFO liquidation has on reported net income, disclosure in the company’s footnotes is needed whenever costs are mismatched in this manner. According to the footnotes to the 2008 financial statements for Alcoa Inc., “during 2008 and 2007, LIFO inventory quantities were reduced, which resulted in a partial liquidation of the LIFO base. The impact of this liquidation increased net income by $25 (million) in 2008 and $20 (million) in 2007.”</p>

        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p18"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: Companies in the United States are allowed to choose FIFO, LIFO, or averaging as an inventory cost flow assumption. Over the years, many U.S. companies have adopted LIFO, in part because of the possibility of reducing income taxes during a period of inflation. However, IFRS rules do not recognize LIFO as appropriate. Why does such strong resistance to LIFO exist outside the United States? If the United States adopts IFRS will all of these companies that now use LIFO have to switch their accounting systems to FIFO or averaging? How much trouble will that be?</p>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p19"><em class="emphasis">Rob Vallejo</em>: The International Accounting Standards Board revised International Accounting Standard No. 2, Inventories (IAS 2), in 2003. The issue of accounting for inventories using a LIFO costing method was debated and I would encourage anyone seeking additional information to read their basis for conclusion which accompanies IAS 2. The IASB did not believe that the LIFO costing method was a reliable representation of actual inventory flows. In other words, in most industries, older inventory is sold to customers before newer inventory. The standard specifically precludes the use of LIFO, but allows for the use of the FIFO or weighted average costing methods as they view these as better representations of actual inventory flows.</p>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p20">Therefore, when companies have to adopt IFRS, the inventory balances and the related impact on shareholders’ equity will be restated as if FIFO or average costing had been used for all periods presented. Most companies keep their books on a FIFO or weighted average cost basis and then apply a LIFO adjustment, so the switch to an alternative method should not be a big issue in a mechanical sense. However, the reason most companies apply the LIFO costing method relates to U.S. tax law. Companies that want to apply LIFO for income tax purposes are required to present their financial information under the LIFO method. The big question still being debated is whether or not U.S. tax law will change to accommodate the move to IFRS. This is very important to U.S. companies, as generally, applying LIFO has had a cumulative impact of deferring the payment of income taxes. If companies must change to FIFO or weighted average costing methods for tax purposes, that could mean substantial cash payments to the IRS. Stay tuned for more debate in this area.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s03_p21">LIFO is popular in the United States because of the LIFO conformity rule but serious theoretical problems do exist. Because of these concerns, LIFO is prohibited in many places in the world because of the rules established by IFRS. The most recent costs are reclassified to cost of goods sold so earlier costs remain in the inventory account. Consequently, this asset account can continue to show inventory costs from years or even decades earlier—a number that would seem to be of little use to any decision maker. In addition, if these earlier costs are ever transferred to cost of goods sold because of shrinkage in inventory, a LIFO liquidation is said to occur. Revenues are from the current year but cost of goods sold may reflect very old cost numbers. Information about LIFO liquidations appears in the footnotes to the financial statements so readers can weigh the impact.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">9.4</span> Merging Periodic and Perpetual Inventory Systems with a Cost Flow Assumption</h2>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p01">At the end of this section, students should be able to meet the following objectives:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_l01">
            <li>Merge a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, and averaging) with a method of monitoring inventory (periodic or perpetual) to arrive at six different systems for determining reported inventory figures.</li>
            <li>Understand that a cost flow assumption is only applied in computing the cost of ending inventory units in a periodic system but is used for each reclassification from inventory to cost of goods sold in a perpetual system.</li>

				<em class="emphasis">Question: In the previous chapter, periodic and perpetual inventory systems were introduced. FIFO, LIFO, and averaging have now been presented. How does all of this material come together for reporting purposes?</em>
				<em class="emphasis bolditalic">How does the application of a cost flow assumption impact the operation of a periodic or a perpetual inventory system?</em>
			</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p03">Answer: Each company that holds inventory must develop a mechanism to both (a) monitor the balances and (b) allow for the creation of financial statements. If a periodic system is used, officials simply wait until financial statements are to be produced before taking a physical count. Then, a formula (beginning inventory plus all purchase costs less ending inventory) is applied to derive cost of goods sold.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p04">In contrast, a perpetual system maintains an ongoing record of the goods that remain on hand and those that have been sold. As noted, both of these systems have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p05">Companies also select a cost flow assumption to specify the cost that is transferred from inventory to cost of goods sold (and, hence, the cost that remains in the inventory T-account). For a periodic system, the cost flow assumption is only applied when the physical inventory count is taken and the cost of the ending inventory is determined. In a perpetual system, each time a sale is made the cost flow assumption identifies the cost to be reclassified to cost of goods sold. That can occur thousands of times each day.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p06">Therefore, companies normally choose one of six systems to monitor their merchandise balances and determine the cost assignment between ending inventory and cost of goods sold:</p>

				<em class="emphasis bolditalic">How does a periodic FIFO system differ from a perpetual FIFO system in maintaining accounting records and reporting inventory totals?</em>
			</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p10">Answer: Regardless of the inventory system in use, several pieces of information are established in this example. These data are factual, not impacted by accounting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p11"><em class="emphasis">Data—Purchase and Sale of WET-5 Bathtubs</em></p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_l04">
        <li>Revenue: Eight units were sold for $1,950 ($600 + $750 + $600)</li>
        <li>Beginning Inventory: Four units costing $110 each or $440 in total were on hand</li>
        <li>Purchases: Eight units were bought during the year costing a total of $1,048 ($360 + $390 + $298)</li>
        <li>Ending Inventory: Four units are still held</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p12"><em class="emphasis">Periodic FIFO</em>. In a periodic system, the cost of the new purchases is the focus of the record keeping. At the end of the period, the accountant must count and then determine the cost of the items held in ending inventory. When using FIFO, the first costs are transferred to cost of goods sold so the cost of the last four bathtubs remain in the inventory T-account. That is the FIFO assumption. The first costs are now in cost of goods sold while the most recent costs remain in the asset account.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p13">In this illustration, the last four costs (starting at the end of the period and moving forward) are two units at $149 each and two units at $130 each for a total of $558. Only after that cost is assigned to ending inventory can cost of goods sold be calculated.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p14">The last costs for the period remain in ending inventory; the first costs have all been transferred to cost of goods sold. This handling reflects the application of the first-in, first-out cost flow assumption.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p15">Based on the application of FIFO, Mayberry reports gross profit from the sale of bathtubs during this year of $1,020 (revenue of $1,950 minus cost of goods sold of $930).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p16"><em class="emphasis">Perpetual FIFO</em>. Perpetual accounting systems are constructed so that costs can be moved from inventory to cost of goods sold at the time of each new sale. With modern computer processing, that is a relatively simple task. Below is one format that provides the information needed for this home improvement store and its inventory of bathtubs. At points A, B, and C, costs are moved from inventory on hand to cost of goods sold based on FIFO. The cost of the first goods in the “inventory on hand” is reclassified to cost of goods sold at each of those three spots.</p>
    <div class="figure large editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_f02">

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p17">On this perpetual inventory spreadsheet, the final cell in the “inventory on hand” column ($558 or two units @ $130 and two units at $149) provides the cost of the ending inventory. Summation of the “cost of goods sold” column reflects that expense for the period ($930 or $330 + $350 + $250).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p18">One important characteristic of FIFO should be noted here. Under both periodic and perpetual FIFO, ending inventory is $558 and cost of goods sold is $930. The reported numbers are identical. The first cost for the period is always the first cost regardless of when the assignment to expense is made. Thus, the resulting amounts will be the same using either FIFO system. For that reason, many companies that apply FIFO maintain perpetual records to track the units on hand throughout the period but ignore the costs. Then, when financial statements are prepared, they use a periodic computation to determine the cost of ending inventory in order to compute cost of goods sold. That allows the company to monitor its inventory quantities daily without the expense and effort of identifying the cost associated with each new sale.</p>

        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s04_p20">Companies that sell inventory choose a cost flow assumption such as FIFO, LIFO, or averaging. In addition, a method must be applied to monitor inventory balances (either periodic or perpetual). Six combinations of inventory systems can result from these two decisions. With any periodic system, the cost flow assumption is only used to determine the cost of ending inventory so that cost of goods sold can be calculated. For perpetual, the reclassification of costs is performed each time that a sale is made based on the cost flow assumption that was selected. Periodic FIFO and perpetual FIFO systems arrive at the same reported balances because the earliest cost is always the first to be transferred regardless of the method being applied.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p03">Answer: <em class="emphasis">Periodic LIFO</em>. In a periodic system, only the computation of the ending inventory is altered by the choice of a cost flow assumption.<span class="footnote" id="hoyle-fn09_005">Because ending inventory for one period becomes the beginning inventory for the next, application of a cost flow assumption does change that figure also. However, the impact is only indirect because the number is simply carried over from the previous period. No current computation of beginning inventory is made based on the cost flow assumption in use.</span> Thus, for this illustration, beginning inventory remains $440 (4 units at $110 each) and the number of units purchased is still eight with a cost of $1,048. The reported figure that changes is the cost of the ending inventory. Four bathtubs remain in stock at the end of the year. According to LIFO, the last costs are transferred to cost of goods sold; only the cost of the first four units remains in ending inventory. That is $110 per unit or $440 in total.</p>
    <div class="figure large editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_f01">

        <img src="section_12/a2e26308c56a8ef1c48854b974350e69.jpg">
        <p class="para">*If the number of units bought equals the number of units sold—as seen in this example—the quantity of inventory remains unchanged. In a periodic LIFO system, beginning inventory ($440) is then the same as ending inventory ($440) so that cost of goods sold ($1,048) equals the amount spent during the period to purchase inventory ($1,048). Therefore, during the year, company officials can keep track of gross profit by subtracting purchases from revenues.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p04">Mayberry Home Improvement Store reports gross profit using periodic LIFO of $902 (revenue of $1,950 less cost of goods sold of $1,048).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p05">Note here that the anticipated characteristics of LIFO are present. Ending inventory of $440 is lower than that reported by FIFO ($558). Cost of goods sold ($1,048) is higher than under FIFO ($930) so that the reported gross profit (and, hence, net income) is lower by $118 ($1,020 for FIFO versus $902 for LIFO).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p09">As can be seen here, periodic and perpetual LIFO do not necessarily produce identical numbers.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p10">Periodic and perpetual FIFO always arrive at the same results. In contrast, balances reported by periodic and perpetual LIFO frequently differ. Although the first cost incurred in a period (the cost transferred to expense under FIFO) is the same regardless of the date of sale, this is not true for the last or most recent cost (expensed according to LIFO).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p11">As an illustration, note that two bathtubs were sold on September 9 in this example. Perpetual LIFO immediately determines the cost of this sale and reclassifies the amount. On that date, the cost of the last two units ($130 each) came from the June 13 purchase. That amount is expensed. In contrast, a periodic LIFO system makes that same determination but not until December 31. As viewed from year’s end, the last costs were $149 each. Although these items were bought on September 22, which is after the last sale, they are included in the cost of goods sold for a periodic LIFO system.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p12">Two bathtubs were sold on September 9 but the identity of the specific costs to be transferred depends on the date on which the determination is made. A periodic system views the costs from the perspective of the end of the year, while perpetual does so immediately when a sale is made.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p14"><em class="emphasis">Question: Not surprisingly, averaging follows a path similar to that of the previous examples. Costs are either moved to cost of goods sold at the end of the year (periodic or weighted average) or at the time of each new sale (perpetual or moving average). The only added variable to this process is the calculation of average cost</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">In the operation of an averaging system, when and how is the average cost of inventory determined?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p15">Answer: <em class="emphasis">Periodic (weighted) average</em>. In the problem being examined here, Mayberry Home Improvement Store eventually held twelve bathtubs. Four of these units were on hand at the start of the year and the other eight were acquired during the period. The beginning inventory cost $440 and the new purchases were bought for a total of $1,048. Thus, these twelve units had a total cost of $1,488 ($440 + $1,048) or $124 per bathtub ($1,488/12 units). When applying a weighted average system, this single average is the basis for both the ending inventory and cost of goods sold to be included in the company’s financial statements. No item actually cost $124 but that average is applied to all units.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p16"><em class="emphasis">Perpetual (moving) average</em>. In this final approach to maintaining and reporting inventory, each time that a company buys inventory at a new price, the average cost is recalculated. Therefore, a moving average system must be programmed to update the average whenever additional merchandise is acquired.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p17">Below, a new average is computed at points D, E, and F. Each time this figure is found by dividing the number of units on hand after the purchase into the total cost of those items. For example, at point D, the company now has four bathtubs. One cost $110 while the other three were acquired for $120 each or $360 in total. Total cost was $470 ($110 + $360) for these four units for a new average of $117.50 ($470/4 units). That average is then used until the next purchase is made. The applicable average at the time of sale is transferred from inventory to cost of goods sold at points A ($110.00), B ($117.50), and C ($126.88) below.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s05_p21">A periodic LIFO inventory system begins by computing the cost of ending inventory at the end of a period and then uses that figure to calculate cost of goods sold. Perpetual LIFO also transfers the most recent cost to cost of goods sold but makes that reclassification at the time of each sale. A weighted average inventory system determines a single average for the entire period and applies that to both ending inventory and the cost of goods sold. A moving average system computes a new average cost whenever merchandise is acquired. That figure is then reclassified to cost of goods sold at the time of each sale until the next purchase is made.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p01">At the end of this section, students should be able to meet the following objectives:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_l01">
            <li>Use information found in footnote disclosure to convert LIFO balance sheet and income statement numbers into their FIFO or current cost equivalents.</li>
            <li>Compute a company’s gross profit percentage and explain the relevance of this figure.</li>
            <li>Calculate the average number of days that inventory is held and provide reasons why companies worry if this figure starts moving upward unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>Compute the inventory turnover and explain its meaning.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question: The point has been made several times in this chapter that LIFO provides a lower reported net income than does FIFO when prices are rising. In addition, the inventory figure shown on the balance sheet will be below current cost if LIFO is applied during inflation. Comparison between companies that are similar can become difficult, if not impossible, when one uses FIFO and the other LIFO. For example, Rite Aid, the drug store giant, applies LIFO while its rival CVS Caremark applies FIFO to the inventory held in its CVS pharmacies. How can an investor possibly compare the two companies? In that situation, the utility of the financial information seems limited</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p03"><em class="emphasis bolditalic">How do experienced decision makers manage to compare companies that apply LIFO to others that do not?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p04">Answer: Significant variations in reported balances frequently result from the application of different cost flow assumptions. Because of potential detrimental effects on these figures, companies that use LIFO often provide additional information to help interested parties understand the impact of this choice. For example, a footnote to the 2008 financial statements of Safeway Inc. and Subsidiaries discloses: “merchandise inventory of $1,740 million at year-end 2008 and $1,886 million at year-end 2007 is valued at the lower of cost on a last-in, first-out (‘LIFO’) basis or market value. Such LIFO inventory had a replacement or current cost of $1,838 million at year-end 2008 and $1,949 million at year-end 2007.” Here, the reader is told that this portion of the company’s inventory was reported as $1,740 million and $1,886 million although really worth $1,838 million and $1,949 million (the equivalent of using FIFO).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p05">If a decision maker is comparing the 2008 year-end balance sheet of Safeway to another company that did not use LIFO, the inventory balance could be increased from $1,740 million to $1,838 million to show that this asset was worth an additional $98 million ($1,838 million less $1,740 million). Thus, the dampening impact of LIFO on reported assets can be removed easily by the reader. Restatement of financial statements in this manner is a common technique relied on by investment analysts around the world to make available information more usable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p06">Adjusting Safeway’s balance sheet from LIFO to current cost (FIFO) is not difficult because relevant information is available in the footnotes. However, restating the company’s income statement to numbers in line with FIFO is a bit more challenging. Safeway reported net income for 2008 of $965.3 million. How would that number have been different with the application of FIFO to all inventory?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p07">As seen in the periodic inventory formula, beginning inventory is added to purchases in determining cost of goods sold while ending inventory is subtracted. With the LIFO figures reported by Safeway, $1,886 million (beginning inventory) was added in arriving at this expense and then $1,740 million (ending inventory) was subtracted. Together, the net effect is an addition of $146 million ($1,886 million less $1,740 million) in computing cost of goods sold for 2008. The expense was $146 million higher than the amount of inventory purchased.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p08">In comparison, if the current cost of the inventory had been used by Safeway, $1,949 million (beginning inventory) would have been added while $1,838 million (ending inventory) subtracted. These two balances produce a net effect on cost of goods sold of adding $111 million.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">LIFO: cost of goods sold = purchases + $146 million</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">FIFO: cost of goods sold = purchases + $111 million</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p09">Under LIFO, cost of goods sold is the purchases for the period plus $146 million. Using current cost, cost of goods sold is the purchases plus only $111 million. The purchase figure is the same in both equations. Thus, cost of goods sold will be $35 million higher according to LIFO ($146 million less $111 million) and net income $35 million lower. If FIFO had been used, Safeway’s reported income would have been approximately $1 billion instead of $965.3 million. Knowledgeable decision makers can easily make this adjustment for themselves to help in evaluating a company. They can determine the amount of net income to be reported if LIFO had not been selected and can then use that figure for comparison purposes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p10">In its 2008 financial statements, Sherwin-Williams simplifies this process by disclosing that its reported net income was reduced by $49,184,000 as a result of applying LIFO. Inclusion of the data was explained by clearly stating that “This information is presented to enable the reader to make comparisons with companies using the FIFO method of inventory valuation.”</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p12"><em class="emphasis">Question: When analyzing receivables in a previous chapter, the assertion was made that companies have vital signs that can be examined as an indication of financial well-being. These are ratios or other computed amounts considered to be of particular significance. In that earlier coverage, the age of the receivables and the receivable turnover were both calculated and explained. For inventory, do similar vital signs also exist that decision makers should study?</em> <em class="emphasis bolditalic">What vital signs should be determined in connection with inventory when examining the financial health and prospects of a company?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p13">Answer: No definitive list of ratios and relevant amounts can be identified because different people tend to have their own personal preferences. However, several figures are widely computed and discussed in connection with inventory and cost of goods sold when the financial condition of a company and the likelihood of its prosperity are being evaluated.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p14"><em class="emphasis">Gross profit percentage</em>. The first of these is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gross profit percentage</a><span class="glossdef">Formula measuring profitability calculated by dividing gross profit (sales less cost of goods sold) by sales.</span></span>, which is found by dividing the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gross profit</a><span class="glossdef">Difference between sales and cost of goods sold; also called gross margin or markup.</span></span> for the period by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">net sales</a><span class="glossdef">Sales less sales returns and discounts.</span></span>.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">sales – sales returns and discounts = net sales</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">net sales – cost of goods sold = gross profit</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">gross profit/net sales = gross profit percentage</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p15">Previously, gross profit has also been referred to as gross margin, markup, or margin of a company. In simplest terms, it is the difference between the amount paid to buy (or manufacture) inventory and the amount received from an eventual sale. Gross profit percentage is often used to compare one company to the next or one time period to the next. If a book store manages to earn a gross profit percentage of 35 percent and another only 25 percent, questions need to be raised about the difference and which percentage is better? One company is making more profit on each sale but, possibly because of higher sales prices, it might be making significantly fewer sales.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p16">For the year ending January 31, 2009, Macy’s Inc. reported a gross profit percentage of 39.7 percent but reported net loss for the year of $4.8 billion on sales of nearly $25 billion. At the same time, Wal-Mart earned a gross profit percentage of a mere 23.7 percent but managed to generate net income of over $13 billion on sales of over $401 billion. With these companies, a clear difference in pricing strategy can be seen.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p17">The gross profit percentage is also watched closely from one year to the next. For example, if this figure falls from 37 percent to 34 percent, analysts will be quite interested in the reason. Such changes have a cause and any individual studying the company needs to consider the possibilities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p18">Are costs rising more quickly than the sales price of the merchandise?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p19">Has a change occurred in the types of inventory being sold?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p20">Was the reduction in the gross profit offset by an increase in sales?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p21">Barnes &amp; Noble, for example, reports that its gross margin was 30.9 percent in 2008 and 30.4 percent in 2007. That is certainly one piece of information to be included in a detailed investigation of this company.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p22"><em class="emphasis">Number of days inventory is held</em>. A second vital sign is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">number of days inventory is held</a><span class="glossdef">Measures the average number of days that a company takes to sell its inventory items; computed by dividing average inventory for the period by the cost of inventory sold per day.</span></span> on the average. Companies want to turn their merchandise into cash as quickly as possible. Holding inventory can lead to several unfortunate repercussions. The longer it sits in stock the more likely the goods are to get damaged, stolen, or go out of fashion. Such losses can be avoided through quick sales. Furthermore, as long as merchandise is sitting on the shelves, it is not earning any profit for the company. Money is tied up with no return until a sale is made.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p23">Consequently, decision makers (both internal and external to the company) watch this figure closely. A change (especially any lengthening of the time required to sell merchandise) is often a warning of problems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p24">The number of days inventory is held is found in two steps. First, the company needs to determine the cost of inventory that is sold each day on the average.<span class="footnote" id="hoyle-fn09_006">Some analysts prefer to use 360 days to make this computation simpler.</span></p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">cost of goods sold/365 days = cost of inventory sold per day</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p25">Then, this daily cost figure is divided into the average amount of inventory held during the period. The average can be based on beginning and ending totals, monthly balances, or other available figures.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">average inventory/cost of inventory sold per day = number of days inventory is held</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p26">For example, if a company sells inventory costing $40,000 each day and holds an average inventory of $520,000 during the period, the average item takes thirteen days ($520,000/$40,000) to be sold. Again, the significance of that figure depends on the type of inventory, a comparison to similar companies, and the change seen in recent periods of time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p27"><em class="emphasis">Inventory turnover</em>. A third vital sign to be presented is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inventory turnover</a><span class="glossdef">Ratio used to measure the speed at which a company sells its inventory; computed by dividing cost of goods sold by average inventory for the period.</span></span>, which is simply another way to measure the speed by which a company sells its inventory.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">cost of goods sold/average inventory = inventory turnover</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p28">The resulting turnover figure indicates the number of times during the period that an amount equal to the average inventory was sold. The larger the turnover number, the faster inventory is selling. For example, Best Buy Co. Inc. recognized cost of goods sold for the year ending February 28, 2009, as $34,017 million. The company also reported beginning inventory for that period of $4,708 million and ending inventory of $4,753 million. Hence, the inventory turnover for this retail electronics giant was 7.23 times during that year.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">($4,753 + $4,708)/2 = average inventory of $4,730.5 million</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">$34,017/$4,703.5 = inventory turnover of 7.23 times</span></span>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p31">Companies that apply LIFO (probably for income tax reasons) often hope decision makers will convert their numbers to FIFO for comparison purposes. Footnote disclosure of FIFO figures can be included to make this conversion possible. In addition, analysts frequently determine several computed amounts and ratios to help illuminate what is happening inside a company. The gross profit percentage simply determines the average amount of markup on each sale. It demonstrates pricing policies and fluctuations often indicate policy changes or problems in the market. The average number of days in inventory and the inventory turnover both help decision makers know the length of time a company takes to sell its merchandise. Traditionally, a slowing down of sales is bad because inventory is more likely to be damaged, lost, or stolen. Plus, inventory generates no profit for the owner until sold.</p>

        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p32">Following is a continuation of our interview with Kevin G. Burns.</p>
        <p class="para"> </p>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p33"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: Companies that sell inventory instead of services must select a cost flow assumption for reporting purposes. What are your thoughts when you are analyzing two similar companies and discover that one has applied FIFO while the other uses LIFO?</p>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch09_s06_p34"><em class="emphasis">Kevin Burns</em>: Truthfully, it is easy to get distracted by issues such as FIFO and LIFO that probably make no difference in the long run. I rarely like to trade stocks quickly. For example, assume a company sells a commodity of some type (jewelry, for example). The commodity fluctuates dramatically in price so when the price is falling you have paid more for the item than the market will now pay you for the finished good. When prices are rising, you reap the benefit by selling at an even greater price than you expected. So if you have two companies dealing with the same issues and one uses LIFO and the other FIFO, the reported results could be dramatically different. However, the underlying facts do not change. Over an extended period of time, the two companies probably end up in the same position regardless of whether they apply LIFO or FIFO. I am much more interested in how they are investing their cash inflows and the quality of the management. On the other hand, a person who trades stocks quickly could well be interested in reported results that might impact stock prices for a short period of time. For example, the trader may well wish to see a company use FIFO as reported profits will be higher for the short term if there is inflation and may believe that he can capitalize on that short-term phenomenon.</p>
