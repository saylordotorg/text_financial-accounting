            <li>Define “transaction analysis” and explain its importance to the accounting process.</li>
            <li>Identify the account changes created by the purchase of inventory, the payment of a salary, and the borrowing of money.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: <em class="emphasis">Information provided by a set of financial statements is essential to any individual analyzing a business or other organization</em>. <em class="emphasis">The availability of a fair representation of a company’s financial position</em>, <em class="emphasis">operations</em>, <em class="emphasis">and cash flows is invaluable for a wide array of decision makers</em>. <em class="emphasis">However</em>, <em class="emphasis">the sheer volume of data that a company such as General Mills</em>, <em class="emphasis">McDonald’s</em>, <em class="emphasis">or PepsiCo must gather in order to prepare these statements has to be astronomical</em>. <em class="emphasis">Even a small enterprise—a local convenience store</em>, <em class="emphasis">for example—generates a significant quantity of information virtually every day</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">How does an accountant begin the process of accumulating all the necessary data so that financial statements can eventually be produced?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_p03">Answer: The accounting process starts by analyzing the effect of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transactions</a><span class="glossdef">Events that have a financial impact on an organization that must be gathered, sorted, classified and turned into financial statements by means of an accounting system.</span></span>—any event that has a financial impact on a company. Large organizations participate in literally millions of transactions each year that must be gathered, sorted, classified, and turned into a set of financial statements that cover a mere four or five pages. Over the decades, accountants have had to become very efficient to fulfill this seemingly impossible assignment. Despite the volume of transactions, the goal remains the same: to prepare financial statements that are presented fairly because they contain no material misstatements according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_p04">For example, all the occurrences listed in <a class="xref" href="#hoyle-ch04_s01_f01">Figure 4.1 "Transactions Frequently Encountered"</a> are typical transactions that any company might encounter. Each causes some measurable effect on a company’s assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains, losses, capital stock, or dividends paid. The accounting process begins with an analysis of each transaction to determine the financial changes that took place. Was revenue earned? Did a liability increase? Has an asset been acquired?</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_p05">In any language, successful communication is only possible if the information to be conveyed is properly understood. Likewise, in accounting, transactions must be analyzed so their impact is understood. A vast majority of transactions are relatively straightforward so that, with experience, the accountant can ascertain the financial impact almost automatically. For transactions with greater complexity, the necessary analysis becomes more challenging. However, the importance of this initial step in the production of financial statements cannot be overstressed. The well-known computer aphorism captures the essence quite succinctly: “garbage in, garbage out.” There is little hope that financial statements can be fairly presented unless the entering data are based on an appropriate identification of the changes created by each transaction.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: <em class="emphasis">Transaction 1—A company buys inventory on credit for $2,000</em>. <em class="emphasis">How does transaction analysis work here?</em> <em class="emphasis bolditalic">What accounts are affected by this purchase?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p02">Answer: Inventory, which is an asset, increases by $2,000. The organization has more inventory than it did prior to the purchase. Because no money has yet been paid for these goods, a liability for the same amount has been created. The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accounts payable</a><span class="glossdef">Short-term liabilities to pay for goods and services that have been acquired.</span></span> is often used in financial accounting to represent debts resulting from the acquisition of inventory and supplies.</p>

        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">accounts payable (liability) increases by $2,000</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p03">Note that the accounting equation described in the previous chapter remains in balance. Assets have gone up by $2,000 while the liability side of the equation has also increased by the same amount to reflect the source of this increase in the company’s assets.</p>

        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p06">Answer: Cash (an asset) is decreased here by $300. Whenever cash is involved in a transaction, determining that change is a good place to start the analysis. Increases and decreases in cash are often obvious.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p07">The cash balance declined here because salary was paid to an employee. Assets were reduced as a result of the payment. That is a cost to the company. Thus, a salary expense of $300 is reported. Recognizing an expense is appropriate rather than an asset because the employee’s work reflects a past benefit. The effort has already been carried out, generating revenues for the company in the previous week rather than in the future.</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">salary expense (expense) increases by $300</span></span>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">cash (asset) decreased by $300</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p08">The continued equilibrium of the accounting equation does exist here although it is less obvious. Assets are decreased. At the same time, an expense is recognized. This expense reduces reported net income. On the statement of retained earnings, current net income becomes a component of retained earnings. The reduction in income here serves to decrease retained earnings. Because both assets and retained earnings go down by the same amount, the accounting equation continues to balance.</p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p09"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: <em class="emphasis">In Transaction 2</em>, <em class="emphasis">the company paid a salary of $300 that it owed to a worker</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">Why does a payment to an employee not reduce a salary payable balance?</em></p>
        <p class="para block"> </p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p10">Answer: Costs such as salary, rent, or interest increase gradually over time and are often referred to as <strong class="emphasis bold">accrued expenses</strong> because the term “accrue” means “to grow.” An accounting system can be mechanically structured to record such costs in either of two ways. The results are the same but the steps in the process differ.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Some companies simply ignore accrued expenses until paid. At that time, the expense is recognized and cash is reduced. No liability is entered into the accounting system or removed. Because the information provided above indicates that nothing has been recorded to date, this approach is used here.</li>
            <li>Other companies choose to program their computer systems so that both the expense and the related liability are recognized automatically as the amount grows. For salary, as an example, this increase could literally be recorded each day or week based on the amount earned by employees. At the time payment is finally conveyed, the expense has already been recorded. Thus, the liability is removed because that debt is being settled. Below, in Transaction 5, this second possible approach to recording accrued expenses is illustrated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p11">A company can recognize an accrued expense (such as a salary) as incurred or wait until payment. This decision depends on the preference of company officials. The end result (an expense is reported and cash decreased) is the same, but the recording procedures differ. As will be discussed, if no entry has been made for such costs prior to the production of financial statements (the first alternative), both the expense and the payable do have to be recognized at that time so that all balances are properly stated for reporting purposes.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p14">Answer: Cash is increased by the amount of money received from the lender.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch04_s01_s01_p15">Most organizations must gather an enormous quantity of information as a prerequisite for preparing financial statements periodically. This process begins with an analysis of the impact of each transaction (financial event). After the effect on all account balances is ascertained, the recording of a transaction is relatively straightforward. The changes caused by most transactions—the purchase of inventory or the signing of a note, for example—can be determined quickly. For accrued expenses, such as salary or rent that grow over time, the accounting system can record the amounts gradually as incurred or only at the point of payment. However, the figures to be reported are not impacted by the specific mechanical steps that are taken.</p>

        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p01">At the end of this section, students should be able to meet the following objectives:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_l01">
            <li>Explain the reason that a minimum of two accounts are impacted by every transaction.</li>
            <li>Identify the account changes that are created by the payment of insurance and rent, the sale of merchandise, the acquisition of a long-lived asset, a capital contribution, the collection of a receivable, and the payment of a liability.</li>
            <li>Separate the two events that occur when inventory is sold and determine the effect of each.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p02"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: <em class="emphasis">Transaction 4—The inventory items that were bought in Transaction 1 for $2,000 are now sold for $5,000 on account</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">What balances are impacted by the sale of merchandise in this manner?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p03">Answer: Two things actually happen in the sale of inventory. First, revenue of $5,000 is generated by the sale. Because the money will not be collected until a later date, accounts receivable (an asset) is initially increased. The reporting of receivable balance indicates that this amount is due from a customer and should be collected at some subsequent point in time.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">accounts receivable (asset) increases by $5,000</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">sales (revenue) increases by $5,000</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p04">Second, the inventory is removed. Companies have an option in the method by which inventory balances are monitored. Here, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perpetual inventory system</a><span class="glossdef">Accounting system that maintains an ongoing record of all inventory items; records increases and decreases in inventory accounts as they occur as well as the cost of goods sold to date.</span></span> will be utilized. That approach has become extremely common due to the prevalence of computer systems in the business world. It maintains an ongoing record of the inventory held and the amount that has been sold to date. All changes in inventory are recorded immediately. However, in a later chapter, an alternative approach—still used by some companies—known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">periodic inventory system</a><span class="glossdef">Accounting system that does not maintain an ongoing record of all inventory items; instead, ending inventory is determined by a physical count so that a formula (beginning inventory plus purchases less ending inventory) can be used to determine cost of goods sold.</span></span> will also be demonstrated.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p05">Since a perpetual system is being used here, the reduction in inventory is recorded simultaneously with the sale. An expense is incurred as inventory costing $2,000 is taken away by the customer. The company’s assets are reduced by this amount. Cost of goods sold (an expense) is recognized to reflect this decrease in the amount of merchandise on hand.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">cost of goods sold (expense) increases by $2,000</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">inventory (asset) decreases by $2,000</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p06">The $3,000 difference between the sales revenue of $5,000 and the related cost of goods sold of $2,000 is known as the gross profit (or gross margin or mark up) on the sale.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p09">Answer: In every transaction, a cause and effect relationship is always present. For example, accounts receivable increases because of a sale. Cash decreases as a result of paying salary expense. No account can possibly change without some identifiable cause. Thus, every transaction must touch a minimum of two accounts. Many transactions actually affect more than two accounts but at least two are impacted by each of these financial events.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p10"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: <em class="emphasis">Transaction 5—The reporting company pays $700 for insurance coverage relating to the past few months</em>. <em class="emphasis">The amount was previously recorded in the company’s accounting system as the cost was incurred</em>. <em class="emphasis">Apparently</em>, <em class="emphasis">computers were programmed to accrue this expense periodically</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">What is the financial impact of paying for an expense if the balance has already been recognized over time as the liability grew larger?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p11">Answer: Several pieces of information should be noted here as part of the analysis.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_l02">
        <li>Cash declined by $700 as a result of the payment.</li>
        <li>This cost relates to a past benefit; thus, an expense has to be recorded. No future economic benefit is created by the insurance payment in this example. Cash was paid for coverage over the previous months.</li>
        <li>The company’s accounting system has already recorded an accrual of this amount. Thus, insurance expense and the related liability were recognized as incurred. This is clearly a different mechanical procedure than that demonstrated in Transaction 2 above for the salary payment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p12">The expense cannot be recorded again or it will be double-counted. Instead, cash is reduced along with the liability established through the accrual process. The expense was recorded already so no additional change in that balance is needed. Instead, the liability is removed and cash decreased.</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">insurance payable (liability) decreases by $700</span></span>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">cash (asset) decreases by $700</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p13">Note that accounting recognition is often dependent on the recording that has taken place. The final results should be the same (here an expense is recognized and cash decreased), but the steps in the process can vary.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p16">Answer: In this transaction, for the first time, three accounts are impacted. A truck is bought for $40,000, so the recorded balance for this asset is increased by that cost. Cash decreases $10,000 while the notes payable balance rises by $30,000. These events each happened. To achieve a fair presentation, the accounting process seeks to reflect the actual occurrences that took place.

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p18">Answer: When cash is contributed to a company for a portion of the ownership, cash obviously goes up by the amount received. This money was not generated by revenues or by liabilities but rather represents assets given freely so that new ownership shares could be issued. This inflow is reflected in the financial statements as increases in the cash and capital stock accounts. Outside decision makers can see that this amount of the company’s net assets came from investments made by owners.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch04_s02_p27">Accountants cannot record transactions without understanding the impact that has occurred. Whether inventory is sold or an account receivable is collected, at least two accounts are always affected because all such events have both a cause and a financial effect. Individual balances rise or fall depending on the nature of each transaction. The payment of insurance, the collection of a receivable, a capital contribution, and the like all cause very specific changes in account balances. One of the most common is the sale of inventory where both an increase in revenue and the removal of the merchandise takes place. Increases and decreases in inventory are often monitored by a perpetual system that reflects all such changes immediately. In a perpetual system, cost of goods sold—the expense that measures the cost of inventory acquired by a company’s customers—is recorded at the time of sale.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p04">Answer: Over five hundred years ago, Venetian merchants in Italy developed a system that continues to serve in the twenty-first century as the basis for accumulating financial data throughout much of the world. Today, when every aspect of modern society seems to be in a constant state of flux, a process that has remained in use for over five centuries is almost impossible to comprehend. However, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double-entry bookkeeping</a><span class="glossdef">A mechanical process created over five hundred years ago and documented by Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli that facilitates the gathering and reporting of financial information.</span></span> procedures that were first documented in 1494 by Fra Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli (a friend of Leonardo da Vinci) remain virtually unchanged by time. Organizations, both small and large, use the fundamentals of double-entry bookkeeping to collect the information needed to produce financial statements that are fairly presented according to the rules of U.S. GAAP.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p05"><em class="emphasis">Question</em>: <em class="emphasis">This assertion sounds like science fiction</em>. <em class="emphasis">It hardly seems believable that Xerox keeps up with over $17.6 billion in revenue (approximately $48 million per day) using the same methods that Venetian merchants applied to their transactions during the Renaissance</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">How can a five-hundred-year</em>-<em class="emphasis bolditalic">old bookkeeping system possibly be usable by today’s modern businesses?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p06">Answer: State-of-the-art computers and other electronic devices are designed to refine and accelerate the financial accounting process but the same basic organizing procedures have been utilized now for hundreds of years. In simplest terms, accounting systems are all created to follow four sequential steps:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_l02">
        <li>Analyze</li>
        <li>Record</li>
        <li>Adjust</li>
        <li>Report</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p07">As explained previously, financial accounting starts by analyzing each transaction—every event that has a monetary impact on the organization—to ascertain the changes created in accounts such as rent expense, cash, inventory, and dividends paid. Fortunately, a vast majority of any company’s transactions are repetitive so that many of the effects can be easily anticipated. A sale on credit always increases both accounts receivable and revenues. Regardless of the time or place, a cash purchase of equipment increases the balance reported for equipment while decreasing cash. Computer systems can be programmed to record the impact of these events automatically allowing the accountant to focus on analyzing more complex transactions.</p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p09">Answer: An essential step in understanding the accounting process is to realize that financial information is accumulated by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accounts</a><span class="glossdef">Detailed records of the transactions and current balances of specific assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses.</span></span>. Every balance to be reported in a company’s financial statements is maintained in a separate account. Thus, for assets, an individual account is established to monitor cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and so on. To keep track of expenses, a number of additional accounts are needed, such as cost of goods sold, rent expense, salary expense, and repair expense. The same is true for revenues, liabilities, and other categories. A small organization might utilize only a few dozen accounts for its entire recordkeeping system. A large company could have thousands.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p10">Based on the original Venetian model, the balance for each account is monitored in a form known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">T-account</a><span class="glossdef">Used to maintain the monetary balance for each of the accounts reported by an organization with a left (debit) side and a right (credit) side.</span></span> as displayed in <a class="xref" href="#hoyle-ch04_s03_f01">Figure 4.2 "Common T-Accounts"</a>. This structure provides room for recording on both the left side (known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">debit</a><span class="glossdef">Left side of a T-account; it is used to show increases in assets, expenses, and dividends paid and decreases in liabilities, contributed capital, and revenues.</span></span> side) and the right side (the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">credit</a><span class="glossdef">Right side of a T-account used to show increases in liabilities, shareholders’ equity, and revenues and decreases in assets, expenses, and dividends paid.</span></span> side).</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p11">One side of each T-account records increases; the other side indicates decreases. For over five hundred years, the following rules have applied.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p12">The following are accounts where debits reflect an increase and credits a decrease:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_l03">
        <li>Expenses and losses</li>
        <li>Assets</li>
        <li>Dividends paid<span class="footnote" id="hoyle-fn04_001">One method to keep track of these accounts initially is to remember them as the “DEAD” accounts: <strong class="emphasis bold">d</strong>ebits increase, <strong class="emphasis bold">e</strong>xpenses and losses, <strong class="emphasis bold">a</strong>ssets, and <strong class="emphasis bold">d</strong>ividends paid. Quickly, though, through practice, such mnemonic devices will not be needed.</span>
</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p13">The following are accounts where credits reflect an increase and debits a decrease:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_l04">
        <li>Liabilities</li>
        <li>Capital stock</li>
        <li>Revenues and gains</li>
        <li>Retained earnings<span class="footnote" id="hoyle-fn04_002">Changes in the balance reported for retained earnings normally do not come as a direct result of a transaction. As discussed previously, this account reflects all the net income earned to date reduced by all dividend payments. Income is made up of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. Accounting recognition of revenues and gains (which increase with credits) lead to a larger retained earnings balance. Expenses, losses, and dividends paid (which all increase with debits) reduce retained earnings. Consequently, credits cause an increase in retained earnings whereas debits produce a decrease.</span>
</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p14">The debit and credit rules for these seven general types of accounts provide a short-hand method for recording the financial impact that a transaction has on any account. They were constructed in this manner so that the following would be true:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">debits must always equal credits for every transaction.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p15">At first, the debit and credit rules might seem completely arbitrary. However, they are structured to mirror the cause and effect relationship found in every transaction. This is the basis of what the Venetian merchants came to understand so long ago: every effect must have a cause.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p16">To illustrate:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_l05">
        <li>Assume an asset (such as cash) increases. As shown above, that is recorded on the debit side of the specific asset’s T-account. What could cause an asset to become larger? A reason must exist. A liability—possibly a bank loan—could have been incurred (recorded as a credit); capital stock could have been issued to an owner (a credit); revenue could have been earned from a sale (a credit); another asset could have been sold (a credit). The list of possible reasons is relatively short. In each case, the debit (increase) to the asset is caused by an equal and offsetting credit.</li>
        <li>Assume an asset (such as cash) decreases. This change is recorded on the credit side of the asset’s T-account. What might cause this reduction? An expense could have been paid (recorded as a debit); a dividend could have been distributed to shareholders (a debit); a liability could have been extinguished (a debit); another asset could have been acquired (a debit). Once again, the cause and effect relationship is reflected; the debits equal the credits. Each effect is set equal and opposite to every potential cause.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p17">There are only seven types of accounts. Therefore, a mastery of debit and credit rules can be achieved with a moderate amount of practice. Because of the fundamental position of debits and credits within every accounting system, this knowledge is well worth the effort required.</p>

        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch04_s03_p19">Most companies participate in numerous transactions each day that must be examined and organized so that financial statements can be prepared. This process requires four steps: analyze, record, adjust, and report. Over five hundred years ago, double-entry bookkeeping was created as a mechanical process to facilitate this gathering and reporting of financial information. A T-account is maintained for each of the accounts (such as cash, accounts payable, and rent expense) to be reported by a company. The left side of the T-account is the debit side, and the right side is the credit. Expenses and losses, assets, and dividends paid increase with debits. Liabilities, revenues and gains, capital stock, and retained earnings increase with credits. Debits always equal credits because every transaction must have both an effect and a cause for that effect.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p06">Answer: When faced with debits and credits, everyone has to practice at first. That is normal and to be expected. These rules can be learned quickly but only by investing a bit of effort. Earlier in this chapter, a number of transactions were analyzed to determine their impact on account balances. Assume now that these same transactions are to be recorded as journal entries. To provide a bit more information for this illustration, the reporting company will be a small farm supply store known as the Lawndale Company that is located in a rural area. For convenience, assume that the company incurs these transactions during the final few days of Year One, just prior to preparing financial statements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p07">Assume further that this company already has the account balances presented in <a class="xref" href="#hoyle-ch04_s04_f01">Figure 4.3 "Balances Taken From T-accounts in Ledger"</a> in its T-accounts before making this last group of journal entries. Note that the total of all the debit and credit balances do agree ($54,300) and that every account shows a positive balance. In other words, the figure being reported is either a debit or credit based on what makes that particular type of account increase. Few T-accounts contain negative balances.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p08">This current listing of accounts is commonly referred to as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trial balance</a><span class="glossdef">List of account balances as shown at a point in time for each of the T-accounts maintained in the company’s ledger; eventually, financial statements are created using these balances.</span></span>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p11">Notice that the word “inventory” is physically on the left of the journal entry and the words “accounts payable” are indented to the right. This positioning clearly shows which account is debited and which is credited. In the same way, the $2,000 numerical amount added to the inventory total appears on the left (debit) side whereas the $2,000 change in accounts payable is clearly on the right (credit) side.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p12">Preparing journal entries is obviously a mechanical process but one that is fundamental to the gathering of information for financial reporting purposes. Any person familiar with accounting procedures could easily “read” the above entry: based on the debit and credit, both inventory and accounts payable have gone up so a purchase of merchandise for $2,000 on credit is indicated. Interestingly, with translation of the words, a Venetian merchant from the later part of the fifteenth century would be capable of understanding the information captured by this journal entry even if prepared by a modern company as large as Xerox or Kellogg.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p15">Payment is made here for past work so this cost represents an expense rather than an asset.

The company’s notes payable balance also goes up by the same amount. As a liability, the increase is recorded through a credit.

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p21">Answer: As discussed previously, two events really happen when inventory is sold. First, the sale is made and, second, the customer takes possession of the merchandise from the company. Assuming again that a perpetual inventory system is in use, both the sale and the related expense are recorded immediately. In the initial part of the transaction, the accounts receivable balance goes up $5,000 because the money from the customer will not be collected until a later date. The increase in this asset is shown by means of a debit. The new receivable resulted from a sale. Revenue is also recorded (by a credit) to indicate the cause of that effect.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p24">Answer: This question reflects a common misconception about the information conveyed through financial statements. As shown above in Journal Entry 4A, recognition of revenue is not tied directly to the receipt of cash. One of the most important elements comprising the structure of U.S. GAAP is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accrual accounting</a><span class="glossdef">System required by U.S. GAAP to standardize the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses; it is made up of the revenue realization principle and the matching principle.</span></span>, which serves as the basis for timing the reporting of revenues and expenses. Because of the direct impact on net income, such recognition issues are among the most complicated and controversial in accounting. The accountant must always determine the appropriate point in time for reporting each revenue and expense. Accrual accounting provides standard guidance (in the United States and throughout much of the world).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p25">Accrual accounting is really made up of two distinct components. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">revenue realization principle</a><span class="glossdef">The portion of accrual accounting that guides the timing of revenue recognition; it states that revenue is properly recognized at the point that the earning process needed to generate the revenue is substantially complete and the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated.</span></span> provides authoritative direction as to the proper timing for the recognition of revenue. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">matching principle</a><span class="glossdef">The portion of accrual accounting that guides the timing of expense recognition; it states that expense is properly recognized in the same time period as the revenue that it helped generate.</span></span> establishes guidelines for the reporting of expenses. These two principles have been utilized for decades in the application of U.S. GAAP. Their importance within financial accounting can hardly be overstated.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p26"><em class="emphasis">Revenue realization principle</em>. Revenue is properly recognized at the point that (1) the earning process needed to generate the revenue is substantially complete and (2) the amount eventually to be received can be reasonably estimated. As the study of financial accounting progresses into more complex situations, both of these criteria will require careful analysis and understanding.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p27"><em class="emphasis">Matching principle</em>. Expenses are recognized in the same time period as the revenue they help create. Thus, if specific revenue is to be recognized in the year 2019, any associated costs should be reported as expenses in that same time period. Expenses are matched with revenues. However, when a cost cannot be tied directly to identifiable revenue, matching is not possible. In those cases, the expense is recognized in the most logical time period, in some systematic fashion, or as incurred—depending on the situation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p28">For the revenue reported in Journal Entry 4A, assuming that the Lawndale Company has substantially completed the work required of this sale and $5,000 is a reasonable estimate of the amount that will be collected, recognition at the time of sale is appropriate. Because the revenue is recognized at that moment, the related expense (cost of goods sold) should also be recorded as can be seen in Journal Entry 4B.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p29">Accrual accounting provides an excellent example of how U.S. GAAP guides the reporting process in order to produce fairly presented financial statements that can be understood by all decision makers around the world.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch04_s04_p31">After the financial effects are analyzed, the impact of each transaction is recorded within a company’s accounting system through a journal entry. The purchase of inventory, payment of a salary, and borrowing of money are all typical transactions that are recorded by means of debits and credits. All journal entries are maintained within the company’s journal. The timing of this recognition is especially important in connection with revenues and expenses. Accrual accounting provides formal guidance within U.S. GAAP. Revenues are recognized when the earning process is substantially complete and the amount to be collected can be reasonably estimated. Expenses are recognized based on the matching principle, which holds that they should be reported in the same period as the revenue they help generate.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p03">Answer: Because of the previous recognition, the expense should not now be recorded a second time. Instead, this payment reduces the liability that was established by the accounting system. Cash—an asset—is decreased, which is shown by means of a credit. At the same time, the previously recorded payable is removed. Any reduction of a liability is communicated by a debit. To reiterate, no expense is included in this entry because that amount has already been recognized.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p04">Note that Journal Entries 2 and 5 differ although the events are similar. As discussed previously, specific recording techniques can be influenced by the manner in which the accounting system has handled earlier events. In Journal Entry 2, neither the expense nor the payable had yet been recorded. Thus, the expense was recognized at the time of payment. For Journal Entry 5, both the expense and payable had already been entered into the records as the amount gradually grew over time. Hence, when paid, the liability is settled but no further expense is recognized. The proper amount is already present in the insurance expense T-account.</p>

However, beyond that limit, any number of accounts can be impacted. Complex transactions often touch numerous accounts. Here, the truck account (an asset) is increased and must be debited. Part of the acquisition was funded by paying cash (an asset) with the decrease recorded as a credit. The remainder of the cost was covered by signing a note payable (a liability). A liability increase is recorded by means of a credit. Note that the debits do equal the credits even when more than two accounts are affected by a transaction.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p22">Answer: Because the sale of land is not viewed as a central portion of this company’s operations, neither revenue nor cost of goods sold is reported as in the sale of inventory. An $11,000 increase in cash is recorded along with the removal of the $8,000 cost of the land that was conveyed to the new buyer. However, to alert decision makers that a tangential or incidental event has taken place, a gain (if the sales price is more than the cost of the land) or a loss (if the sales price is less than cost) is recognized for the difference. The effect on net income is the same but the reporting has changed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p23">Often, the resulting gain or loss is then separated from revenues and expenses on the company’s income statement to more clearly communicate information as to the nature of the transaction. Consequently, neither revenue nor cost of goods sold is found in the entry below as was shown above in Journal Entries 4A and 4B.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p25"><em class="emphasis">Question: Accrual accounting, as specified in the revenue realization principle, mandates that revenues should not be recognized until the earning process is substantially complete. Assume a customer gives the Lawndale Company $3,000 in cash for some type of service to be performed at a future date. The work has not yet begun. Thus, Lawndale cannot report revenue of $3,000</em>. <em class="emphasis bolditalic">How is a cash inflow recorded if it is received for work before the earning process is substantially complete?</em></p>
    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p26">Answer: Although the company collected money, accrual accounting dictates that revenue cannot yet be recognized. The earning process here will not take place until sometime in the future. As an asset, the cash account is increased (debit) but no revenue can be recorded. Instead, an unearned revenue account is set up to recognize the $3,000 credit. This balance is reported by the Lawndale Company as a liability. Because the money has been accepted, the company is obliged to provide the service or return the $3,000 to the customer. Recording this liability mirrors the company’s future responsibility.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p29">Answer: Cash is reduced by this distribution to the company’s owners. As an asset, a credit is appropriate. The cause of the decrease was payment of a dividend. Hence, a dividends paid account is established. According to the debit and credit rules, dividends paid is listed as one of the accounts that increases through a debit. Thus, the recording of this last illustration is as follows.</p>

    <p class="para block"> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p31">Answer: In an accounting system, the recording process is composed of two distinct steps.</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_l02">
        <li>After analyzing the financial impact of a transaction, a journal entry is created to reflect the impact on relevant accounts.</li>
        <li>Then, each individual debit and credit is added to the specific T-account being altered, a process known as “posting.” A debit to cash in a journal entry is listed as a debit in the cash T-account. A credit made to notes payable is recorded as a credit within the notes payable T-account. After all entries are posted, the current balance for any account can be determined by adding the debit and the credit sides of the T-account and netting the two.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p32">Historically, posting the individual changes shown in each journal entry to the specific T-accounts was a tedious and slow process performed manually. Today, automated systems are designed so that the impact of each entry is simultaneously recorded in the proper T-accounts found in the ledger.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p33">For illustration purposes, the journal entries recorded above have been posted into ledger T-accounts shown in <a class="xref" href="hoyle-ch04_s04#hoyle-ch04_s04_f02">Figure 4.4 "Journal Entry 1: Inventory Acquired on Credit"</a>. Each account includes the previous balance (PB) found in the trial balance shown in <a class="xref" href="hoyle-ch04_s04#hoyle-ch04_s04_f01">Figure 4.3 "Balances Taken From T-accounts in Ledger"</a> at the start of the illustrated transactions. The additional debits and credits recorded for each of the fourteen sample transactions include the number of the corresponding journal entry for cross-referencing purposes. The debit and credit sides of each account can be summed and netted at any point to determine the current balance (CB).</p>

        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p34">Initial coverage of the recording of basic transactions is concluded here through analysis of the payment of insurance, the contribution of capital, the purchase and sale of land, the receipt of cash prior to work being performed, the payment of dividends to owners, and the like. After the impact of each event is ascertained, debits and credits are used to record these changes. These journal entries are then posted to the appropriate T-accounts used to monitor ever-changing account balances. All the T-accounts are collectively known as a ledger or general ledger. Journal entries document the effect of transactions. T-accounts and the ledger maintain the current balance of every account.</p>

In your years as an investment advisor, has this knowledge ever proven to be helpful to you and your career?</p>
        <p class="para" id="hoyle-ch04_s05_p37"><em class="emphasis">Kevin Burns</em>: Although I never planned to be an accountant when I was in college, I found the internal logic of the debit and credit rules quite fascinating. Thinking through transactions and figuring out the proper recording process was a great introduction to business operations. In all honesty, as an investment advisor, I am more interested in asset values and other balance sheet information than the accounting process necessary to gather this information. However, I also happen to own a restaurant and I always find it interesting when I dig through the specific expense accounts looking for ways to be more efficient. For instance, recently when I saw that we had spent a lot of money last year on building maintenance, I could not imagine how that was possible. I dug through the T-account myself and found a recording error that needed to be fixed. My background allowed me to understand the entire process. Frequently, as I study the various debits within our expenses, I am able to spot areas where the restaurant can save money.</p>
